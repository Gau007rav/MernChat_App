This application facilitates real-time communication between two users through the integration of Socket.io for seamless chat functionality. Additionally, it supports the creation of group chats, allowing users to add or remove participants as needed.

Key Features:

Real-time Chat: Enables instant messaging between users with real-time updates.
Group Chat: Allows users to create group chats, and manage participants by adding or removing members.
Secure Authentication: Implements robust authentication mechanisms using the MERN stack and JSON Web Tokens to protect user information and ensure secure access.
